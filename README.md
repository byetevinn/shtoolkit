* ⚙️ Centralized config via `.shtk.json` (for `tree` ignores and `output` settings)
* 🔍 Ignore rules by name, folder and glob
* 📦 JSON and YAML output
* 📊 Detailed statistics
* 🚫 Robust error handling

## 📚 Documentation

* [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md)
* [Commands](./docs/commands.md)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Run:

```bash
shtk init
```

This creates a `.shtk.json` file used by commands to configure ignore lists and output delivery (such as copy limits).

> ℹ️ Note: both `tree` and `copy-content` read `output` settings from `.shtk.json` to decide between text clipboard and file clipboard delivery.

---

## 📋 Smart Output Delivery

Both `tree` and `copy-content` support smart output delivery to improve workflow efficiency, especially when feeding files to AI models (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude):

* **Mode (`output.mode = "auto"`)**: By default, small outputs (up to `textMaxChars`, default `3000` characters) are copied directly as plain text.
* **Automatic File Caching**: If the output length exceeds the character limit, a temporary file is automatically created, and the actual file object is copied to your clipboard.
* **WSL & Windows Native Focus**: The real file clipboard integration is optimized to run smoothly on both native Windows and WSL environments, resolving paths dynamically.

## 🧠 Ignore Rules

### `names`

Ignore files/folders anywhere

```json
"names": ["node_modules", ".git"]
```

### `filesIn`

Ignore files inside specific folders

```json
"filesIn": ["screenshots", "src/temp/uploads"]
```

### `patterns`

Glob support

```json
"patterns": ["*.log", "*.tmp"]
```

---

## 📊 Example Output

### JSON

```json
{
  "name": "project",
  "type": "folder",
  "children": []
}
```

### YAML

```yaml
name: project
type: folder
children: []
```
